Exploratory data analysis of the PUBG(Player Unknown Battleground) Mobile/PC/PS/Xbox game statistics for different in-game modes like Solo, Duo and Squad players battling for the Top Position in their Respective Categories. 

The csv files contain many columns, and you can further divide the columnns into your choice into categories of:
* Solo
* Duo
* Squad

In these notebook I have only done the Data exploration of solo columns only though it reached more than 60MB due to interactive graphs.

Necessary library used for EDA are:-
* matplotlib
* plotly
* cufflinks
* seaborn

you can download the notebook and run in your local machine. As plotly graphs are not supported by github.
In the future I will try to save the graphs img and upload into the notebook as a markdown for a better viewing experience.
